# Custom-A-Link-Between-Worlds-Player-Models
this is a repo i created so people dont have to deal with gamebananas awful upload procedure

for installation.
just copy the 00040000000EC300 inside the models folder that you want and paste it in Citra\load\mods for citra or luma\titles for hardware

im just learning github so i apologise for any future problems that arise 

if you create or port a model and want it in the repo
either pull request it or hit me up on discord

you can find me in the albw randomizer and modding discord
